# JRDS (Just Rotating Dishwashing System)

JRDS (Just Rotating Dishwashing System) is a modular, water-powered dishwashing system designed for home sinks. This eco-friendly system uses high-pressure water jets and 360-degree rotating nozzles driven purely by water flow, requiring no electricity. JRDS aims to offer an efficient, cost-effective, and easy-to-install dishwashing solution that could become a new standard for homes and businesses alike.
